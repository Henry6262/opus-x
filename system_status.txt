System logs analysis:
1. Backend: Market data fetching (Birdeye/DexScreener) is working.
2. Rate Limits: Jupiter API is hitting 429 errors consistently (likely free tier limits).
3. AI Analysis: Skipping frequently due to "critical criteria failed" (mostly low market cap < $35k).
4. Database: Watchlist DB operations are succeeding.
5. Frontend: Should display these events in the "Analysis Feed".
